current problem
- get simple interactive modding to work

atomic operations
- add/rem node
- add/rem conn

effects on underlying maps
- add node: add key
- rem node: rem key
- add conn: add key
- rem conn: rem key

conflict resolution can just be ours/theirs and you move the bad commit and
then an undo before the good one.  that loses less info than alternatives.
